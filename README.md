# counterclockwise
This JavaScript code creates a functional analog clock that runs counter-clockwise using an HTML canvas element. It draws the clock face, numbers, and hands (hour, minute, and second) while updating the time every second. The clock's design, including its size, colors, and positions of various elements, is defined within the code.
